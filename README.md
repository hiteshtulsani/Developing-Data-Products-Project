### Developing Data Products 

#### Class Project
This repository contains submission for Developing Data Products class. It's divided into two parts - [Shiny Application](https://hiteshtulsani.shinyapps.io/Simulating-Sampling-Distributions/) and [Pitch Presentation](http://hiteshtulsani.github.io/Developing-Data-Products-Project/index.html) as required by the Project.

The application explores the use of `fluidPage` layout, `conditionalPanel`, `sliderInput`, `numericInput`, `actionButton`, `tableOutput`, `MathJax` within `Shiny`, `isolate`, Custom CSS, `renderPlot` and `renderTable` controls to name a few.

The [Pitch Presentation](http://hiteshtulsani.github.io/Developing-Data-Products-Project/index.html) for the project uses modified version of [slidify.css](https://github.com/hiteshtulsani/Developing-Data-Products-Project/blob/master/libraries/frameworks/io2012/css/slidify.css). So, as a side note, please make sure to include this file in `libraries/frameworks/io2012/css/` path for reproducibility, if you wish to `Slidify` the Pitch locally.

Following are the main contributing Files:
